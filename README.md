# ðŸ§¬ DNA Folding Simulator

A modular simulation that generates plausible DNA strand structures using trend-following stochastic modeling. This tool creates semi-random nucleotide positions that follow a general spatial trajectory, adding local noise to reflect real-world irregularity in folding behavior.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project simulates DNA folding at the nanometer scale using a simplified model. Rather than performing a full physics-based simulation, the strand is generated through a combination of:
- A global directional trend (e.g., linear or helical)
- Local randomness to simulate thermal or structural noise

This approach balances realism and performance, allowing the generation of diverse DNA conformations for visualization, concept testing, or educational use.

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Basis
This simulator approximates DNA folding using simplified physical principles. It does not perform full molecular dynamics, but incorporates the following key interactions:

- **Backbone Bonds as Springs**  
  Covalent bonds between consecutive nucleotides (within a strand) are modeled as linear springs using Hookeâ€™s law. This maintains chain continuity and spacing.

- **Strand Pairing as Springs**  
  Complementary strand connections (e.g., A-T, C-G) are also modeled as springs, enforcing base-pairing constraints and double-helix tendencies.

- **Electrostatic Repulsion**  
  Each nucleotide is treated as having a small partial charge. All nucleotides repel each other based on Coulombâ€™s law, promoting realistic spacing and discouraging overlaps. The repulsion is computed pairwise across the entire strand.

This hybrid of deterministic and stochastic behavior allows the system to simulate biologically plausible folding patterns with low computational cost. The forces are implemented with tunable constants and are designed to support future upgrades to full 3D force interactions or energy minimization.
